# Conclusion {-}

Successfully extracting the data from 1825 record sheets and 1137 technical drawings has not only provided further insight into Neolithic production and trade, but also shown that it can be useful to digitize legacy data formats, and demonstrated a reproducible workflow. Revisiting the ‘numerical taxonomy’ method years after its adoption into archaeology and comparing against a more modern morphometric method has demonstrated why it fell out of favour, but also that size should still be considered when studying the form of artefacts. Other morphometric analyses, from past decades and recent, neglect to compare size and shape, instead focusing on one or the other.  Automating the production of binary masks for use with morphometric packages has demonstrated that this too can be made reproducible, in addition to the analysis itself, and removes the subjective aspect of placing landmarks. The outline analysis of the processed drawings revealed that there are reasonably distinct groups of shapes within this sample of Neolithic axes from Britain, and this could be useful insight for future research. Taken alongside their stone groups, these broad shape categories could be used to determine whether similar shapes originate from certain industrial areas. Crowdsourcing transcriptions of the record sheets highlighted potential difficulties which can arise if initial data collection is not carried out with potential future users in mind. If archaeology is pursuing a philosophy of open data, then hygenic and logical data collection strategies must be made mainstream. The reproducible workflow of this project has utilised tools such as GNU Make and Docker which are typically used for creating software, in order to not only make the analyses reproducible, but also the data extraction and cleaning, and to facilitate the use of large swathes of packages without compromising reproducibility. The author hopes to see similar reproducible strategies being utilized within archaeology in the coming decades.
