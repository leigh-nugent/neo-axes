## Archaeological context: British Neolithic axes

In the 1920s there was a slow move away from a more antiquarian collector’s approach where preservation and appearance of axes were important above all else.
This change was spurred on by such studies as Thomas 1923, a geologist who inspected characteristic inclusions in the stonehenge ‘foreign’ blue stones and found the same pattern in boulders in Pembrokeshire, Wales and followed them into the Prescelly Mountains, where more of this type of rock was found in situ (Thomas 1923 p247, 248). Axes and other stone artefacts found in areas with no stone source were classed as ‘foreign’ (Clough 1979 p 1).  This was aided by the Geological Survey started at the turn of the 1900s, which the author was part of. Another pivotal development was that archaeologists in southern England began taking thin sections of axes to analyse, which kept the structural integrity of the axe itself but allowed the study of internal inclusions with a microscope (Clough 1979 p 1). This technique was used by the Sub-Committee of the South-Western Group of Museums and Art Galleries on the Petrological Identification of Stone Axes, formed in 1936, which also named the first set of petrological groups, and eventually published a petrological report of more than 200 specimens. The main aim of the South-West Committee was essentially to analyse the petrography of stone artefacts, normally tools, collate previous work and publish the results, as outlined by Keiller in 1937 (p485). The 1941 report asserts that a previous hindrance in the study of stone artefacts was that their owners forbade any modification, however minute, which meant that petrologists were expected to identify the type of stone just from the surface. Due to the nature of axe manufacture, this was impractical, as much of the surface would have been worn away by grinding, polishing etc (Keiller 1941 p50). This publication further cemented the idea that artefacts were no longer just pieces in a display cabinet but specimens for scientific investigation. Meanwhile, disputes between petrologists, geologists and collectors in Wales hindered the uptake of this type of analysis for a couple of decades (comments Grimes 1932). Later, the South-West Committee’s records were integrated with those from the rest of England and the national survey is created, the central committee of which becomes the Implement Petrology Committee. The Committee was responsible for publishing the largest stone implement survey so far, Stone Axe Studies ii, recording the petrology of 7625 axes, which ranged in period from the early Neolithic to the Bronze Age. This exhaustive survey covered all of the UK, with the largest number coming from south-west England (Clough 1988, p3). Important provenancing information was discovered and recorded for an unprecedented amount of artefacts in this survey, forming the basis for future research on exchange and production of these items, a topic that is once again prominent in the current literature. Later, the Implement Petrology Committee would become the Implement Petrology Group, which still exists today.

Shortly after its publication, however, reviews of Stone Axe Studies ii expressed disappointment that the volume mainly reported the results of petrological analyses, and did not attempt to address such contentious topics as the distinction between petrological groups, or what may have led to the dispersal of these artefacts at such distances from their sources, and in such close proximity to other raw materials (Edmonds 1989, p633). However, it its defense, Stone Axe Studies ii did exactly what it set out to do. Mike Pitts, the author of the dataset in this dissertation, cited such reviews in his 1996 paper as he too thought that the 1988 IPC volume left more to be desired. He states that because of the heavy focus on finding the origin of stone implements for the past few decades, there had been little interest in methods of manufacture, potential differing functions, or emergent styles of stone implements. Pitts also points out that there was often disagreement between petrologists on which stone group an axe belonged to, highlighting the subjective nature of previous categorisation methods (Pitts 1996, p311). The 1996 paper includes a dimensional morphometric analysis of the axe dataset compiled by Pitts, in addition to the creation of six much broader axe groups (p313). There had been forays into similar morphometric analyses in the past, however these were usually concerning Upper Palaeolithic handaxes, and not Neolithic axe heads (Roe 1969, Thomas 1972).

In recent years, Neolithic axes have received renewed attention, with investigations ranging from those concerning their potential meanings to those investigating why they were dispersed or manufactured in the way that they were. Stone Axe Studies iii (2011), the latest volume of the IPC’s series, presented the latest findings about stone implement artefacts at home and abroad, with a number of the British articles concerning Neolithic axes. Within this volume, an article of a more speculative nature focuses on the meaning of the axes to Neolithic people. Darvill (p140) suggests that the stone chosen for axe manufacture may have had symbolic significance, such as the white spots in dolorite representing parts of the soul. Amongst the studies more focused on structure and function, Clarke (p319) observes that Neolithic axes in Orkney tended to differ in size depending on the context they were found in, for example larger, more complete specimens being found in graves. A significant study is that by Walker (2015), who posited that imported axe heads from incoming immigrant populations from continental Europe had influence on how axes were made in Neolithic Britain, and resulted in copying. She additionally suggests that the difficult-to-reach nature of many quarry sites in Britain could be part of the reason why these locations were chosen, perhaps as a form of pilgrimate or rite of passage. In addition to the emergence of more discussions surrounding the structure and function of Neolithic axes in Britain, radiocarbon dating was being used increasingly in conjunction with provenance data in order to ascertain how tool use, manufacture and demography changed over time, and whether they were linked. One such example is the NEOMINE project undertaken by Shennan *et al.* (2017), which was able to ascertain that mining activity in Britain coincided with a period of forest clearing that preceeded the introduction of farming by approximately 200 years (p78). The main impetus of this project was to collect radiocarbon dates for all of Britain’s Neolithic mines. The authors also suggest that Neolithic populations from the continent immigrated to Britain and brought farming techniques with them, beginning to mine and clearing forests beforehand. In Scotland, we also know elm and birch pollen percentages rapidly declined in the Beinn Lawers palaeoenvironmental record around 3350 cal BC, which coincided with the uptake of stone axe manufacture at Creag na Caillich (Tipping *et al.* 1993, p595).

Within the last year, three papers have been published from a project titled ‘Supply and Demand in Neolithic Europe’, which makes further use of the NEOMINE radiocarbon dates. The first of these 
backs up the previous assertion that itinerant European Neolithic groups were mining for materials to make axes with in response to the need for tools to clear forests. The aforementioned 200 year period of intensive axe production and forest clearing appears to be unique to Britain as northwest Europe does not show similar behaviour before the transition to farming (Schauer *et al.* 2019a, p157). It is suggested that demand for axes here may instead be a response to the appearance of imported Alpine Jade axes of high symbolic or status significance (p158). Since Pitts’ paper in which he devised new, broader stone groups, geochemical analyses have actually helped to assert that the original IPC groupings are useful after all, representing actual groups of axes with homogenous provenance (Shauer *et al.* 2019 b, p2). Spatial analysis of Neolithic axehead findspots has recently indicated that the majority of similar stone axe heads tend to be found near to their original source, however axes made from certain types of stone appear to be found further afield than others (p15, p20). Perhaps this could be due to the strength of the raw material that the axes are made from, which could either indicate preference or simply less likelihood of breakage in transit. Finally, 39 new results from two different radiocarbon calibration methods, using radiocarbon dates from the NEOMINE project, indicate that almost all of the quarries and mines, in both north and south England, were in activity contemporaneously (Edinborough *et al.* 2020, p27). This then means that differing shape or size which tends to be characteristic of one industrial area, for example the Langdale industry, is not a product of change over time, but a distinct type that existed alongside others in Britain. The fact that the start dates of these mines are all very similar also shows the sheer scale of the demand for these axes (p27). It has also been suggested that the immigrant Neolithic populations were from Brittany, as they had already began to manufacture high-quality axes similar to those made of jade from the Alps.

## Methodological context in archaeology

### Data extraction methods

For text and data extraction in archaeology from handwritten documents, there appears to be two routes which are most pursued. These are transcription or handwriting text recognition (HTR) methods. The former appears to be more popularly used for analog datasets compiled by other archaeologists. Non-digital datasets come with their own problems, such as not being collected with the intention of others using it initially, or not having potential computational methods for extraction/analysis in mind (Faniel *et al.* 2018, p106), particularly with legacy datasets. Much archaeological data is still paper-based (Emmitt *et al.* 2019, p1), and as computational methods become more prevalent in archaeology, this data will need to be digitized. Even if archaeological data has been digitized, sometimes this is in the form of scanned images, for example the dataset in this project, which was scanned in 2016 (see appendix); this is more akin to data backup. For very large digitization projects, crowdsourcing could be a favourable option, and the MicroPasts crowdsourcing platform has been used for this increasingly within archaeology. Released in 2013 and developed mainly by UCL and The British Museum, one of its first projects involved the transcription of over 30,000 artefact information cards about Bronze Age metal objects (Bonacchi *et al.*, 2014, p63). The platform was borne out of concern for the lack of open data in archaeology, coupled with an ambition for fostering institutional and community collaboration. Current transcription projects include one which involves Leonard Woolley’s field notes. Other crowdsourcing platforms include the more well-known Zooniverse, launched in 2007, which is much more general in subject area. HTR is an alternative to transcription, however archaeological applications in recent years tend to be on ancient data, for example Akkadian (Gordin *et al.* 2020) or ancient Tamil (Durga and Maheswari 2019, p2612) inscriptions.

In terms of extracting data from images prior to morphometric analysis, it appears that many studies have done this manually. This process usually necessitates the creation of an outline and the placing of equally spaced coordinates around it. One early example places coordinates around photographs of human phalanxes using a digitizer tablet (Palmqvist *et al.* 1996, p105). A number of studies have used drawings of Bronze Age axes traced from a corpus of images for their morphometric analysis, which were scanned (Forel *et al.* 2009 p722, Monna *et al.* 2013 p510, Wilczek *et al.* 2015 p383). Coordinates around the outlines were extracted by manually selecting the start and end points in Forel *et al.* 2009, however Monna *et al.* 2013 used an unprovided MATLAB script, and Wilczek *et al.* 2015 does not say how their points were extracted. Some more recent studies use software called tpsDIG2 to extract landmarks (on Middle Palaeolithic bifaces Ioviţă 2010 p243; Acheulian handaxes Iovita 2017 p10), however this still appears to be manual, and slightly cumbersome as it can only do one image at a time, each of which need to be inspected by the user for correctness. A most recent study, which lists a co-creator of Momocs as a co-author, uses Photoshop to create outline silhouettes of ancient barley grains and ImageJ to manually place landmarks (Wallace *et al.* 2019 p1129). 

### Morphometric analysis

Morphometric analysis is the statistical treatment of size and shape (Claude 2008, p1). Applications of morphometric analysis in archaeology first dealt with size only, taking the form of multivariate analyses on artefact measurements under the name ‘numerical taxonomy’, which first arose in the 1960s. Taking inspiration from two publications which introduced this method within biology (Doran and Hodson 1975 p159, Shennan 1988 p192), proponents of this method hoped that it would be a good way of checking if traditional classification was valid or not, and also be useful for large datasets of artefacts (Doran and Hodson 1975 p186). In one of the very earliest instances of this method which was used as a case study for others (Hodson 1971 p37), numerical taxonomy is introduced as an objective method of study, proposed for use in grouping British lower and upper Palaeolithic handaxes (Roe 1969 p23). With this adoption came a number of publications also voicing concern that this method may be reinforcing the bad aspects of archaeological classification, for example forcing the existence of types (Thomas 1972 p39), and that results were validated on whether or not they fitted pre-established types (Shennan 1988 p193, 194). This is also the method used in Pitts’ paper (1996),  by log-transforming 56 different measurements so that they are normalised, then performing PCA, k-means and linear discriminant analysis. In recent years it appears that this method has fallen out of favour in archaeology

Similarly to numerical taxonomy, archaeologists later took influence again from biology, or biometrics, and began to consider shape rather than size. These more complex morphometric methods do not appear to arise in archaeology until the mid 1990s (Wilczek *et al.* 2015 p382). One such example is that of a study on Acheulian handaxes from Israel, where landmarks were placed on outlines of the axes where measurements were taken manually, and then the landmark positions were compared between the axes. This was done by using Hotelling’s t2 to test for statistically significant differences in mean landmark position on outlines drawn in two-dimensional cartesian space from their measurements (Brande and Saragusti 1996, p425).  Another contemporary study uses elliptical fourier analysis on a human phalanx to compare it to gorilla, Old World monkey, and other human phalanxes (Palmqvist *et al.* 1996 p99). In recent years, morphometric analyses in archaeology have increasingly focused on comparing axe shapes from certain periods. One early example is Forel *et al.* 2009, who use discrete cosine transform, a Fourier-related method on lateral ribs of bronze age axes in the form of line drawings, implemented with MATLAB (p723).  Another study from around the same time examined and compared resharpened stone tools at different stages in their use-lives using Elliptical Fourier Analysis (Ioviţă 2010, p243). In the last decade, the `Momocs` R package for shape morphometrics has been increasingly used in archaeology. The impetus behind Momocs was to create one package for outline morphometric analysis in R, which as yet had not existed, and currently existing packages focused on landmark placing (Bonhomme 2014, p4). Wilczek et al 2015 use Momocs alongside a vast number of other methods to reveal groups in Bronze Age flanged axes (p385). A 2017 paper uses elliptical Fourier analysis with Momocs to investigate whether Acheulian handaxes became more symmetrical in design as time progressed (Iovita 2017 pxxx). High-def digital photos and 3D scans, British Museum people using Momocs (2020 Garcia-Medrano *et al.* P5). None of these three studies compare Momocs or shape morphometrics to other methods, however, and both import coordinates from outside the package, despite the fact that Momocs is equipped to create them.

### Reproducibility

Something many of the studies mentioned in this section have in common is that their computational analyses or data extraction methods are not reproducible. This is true even for the more recent publications mentioned, for example those using Momocs, a package made to facilitate reproducibility in morphometric analyses, as they manually extracted points from the outlines before importing. The sharing and citation of data, as well as the sharing of reproducible methods used to arrive at published results, is still relatively rare in archaeology (Lodwick 2019, p14). Materials and methods sections of archaeological research papers can often be vague, sometimes not even citing all software used. Not only does this damage the credibility of published results as colleagues are unable to ascertain whether these methods actually do work, it also means that the methods cannot be improved upon or utilized by others, or perhaps even used again by their authors (Marwick 2017 p425). Even if methods are shared fully, often archaeologists are using proprietary software such as SPSS or MATLAB (Marwick 2017 p431), which either uses point-and-click methods or is behind a paywall. Furthermore, it prevents collaboration with experts from other fields. Meanwhile, open data practices are becoming more common in archaeology, particularly in archaeozoology, however also in archaeobotany (Lodwick 2019). There is also MicroPasts, which stores publicly available crowdsourced datasets, and the new *Journal of Open Archaeology Data*, which publishes descriptions of datasets and information on how to access them.
