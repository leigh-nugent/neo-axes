British Neolithic axes, due to their numerousness and long survivability, provide a wealth of evidence with which to study non-subsistence production and trade in this period. They have long been ubiquitous in archaeological literature, however one aspect about these pervasive tools which has rarely been explored is their differing morphology. In addition, much archaeological data is paper-based or not digitised, and most likely lies unused in national or personal archives. This paper sets out to extract data from an old analogue dataset containing information about a large sample of British Neolithic axes, and attempts to use this to investigate potential groups based on their shape and size, in addition to carrying out everything reproducibly. Firstly data was extracted using crowdsourcing to transcribe record sheets and image processing techniques to digitise technical sketches. These data extraction methods were mostly successful. The sheet data, containing measurements, was subjected to multivariate statistics, and the processed images were Fourier-transformed and subjected to the same statistics. Finally their find places were plotted. This revealed that it is easier to group the axes based on shape, however shape and size do not dictate one another, and find places of similar axes do not cluster geospatially.
