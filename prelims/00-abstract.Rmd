British Neolithic axes, due to their numerousness and long survivability, provide a wealth of evidence with which to study non-subsistence production and trade in this period. They have long been ubiquitous in archaeological literature, however one aspect about these pervasive tools which has rarely been explored is their differing morphology. In addition, much archaeological data is paper-based or not digitised, and most likely lies unused in national or personal archives. This paper sets out to extract data from an old analogue dataset containing information about a large sample of British Neolithic axes, and attempts to use this to investigate potential groups based on their shape and size, in addition to carrying out everything reproducibly. Firstly data was extracted using crowdsourcing to transcribe record sheets and image processing techniques to digitise technical sketches. The sheet data, containing measurements, was then subjected to PCA and k-means clustering, and the processed images were Fourier-transformed and subjected to the same statistics. The results of these analyses suggest that groups of similarly shaped axes exist within this sample. Further, this dissertation demonstrates a reproducible workflow which can be used for large projects built with substantial software.
