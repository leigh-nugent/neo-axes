2. all of 'damage' may be ancient. There are some slightly rounded ground facets on the blade edge (see drawing) up to c. 1mm across. On the assumption that these were put on as part of a resharpening process (not completed), the dashed line is a suggestion of the blade shape before the 'damage'. All blade measurements are taken, when affected, from this dashed line. The ground facets do not fill in a straight line, as would probably have been the case if this piece once had a continuous rounded blade edge.

N.30 is a homogeneous looking grey stone, apparently worked by flaking. N.73 is grey with fine darker mottling throughout, & seems to have been shaped by pecking. Where heavily ground, N.73 is smooth-surfaced: this is especially so on blade, & to a less extent on + around side & poll edges. Elsewhere, the pecked surface shows through + overall the stone lacks the sine of the fully ground parts of N.73, or the whole surface N.30.

Wilts' collection, including 4 celts from Andoversford. 90012 is illustrated (Plate II, no.18), but not 90010 or 90011. Of the 4 listed, one other is illustrated - not one of these IX celts. No other information is given than provenance. It seems likely that these come from a collection - perhaps bought in Andovers ford? See also Museum Diary p.73. Evens et al. 1972 (p. 242) do not consider this possibility.",11.7.78,"",'Andoversford',"C.N.F.C. J
